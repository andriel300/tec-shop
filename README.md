## üí° Problems Solved & Best Practices Demonstrated

This project tackles common challenges in modern application development, showcasing elegant solutions:

- **Scalable Authentication:** Integrated **Auth0** as a robust Identity Provider (IdP) for social logins and external authentication, offloading complex identity management. This ensures secure, scalable, and flexible user authentication without reinventing the wheel.
- **Secure Passwordless/MFA:** Implemented a **One-Time Password (OTP)** system for enhanced security. This allows for passwordless login flows and can serve as a second factor for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), significantly improving user security and convenience.
- **Efficient Temporary Data Handling:** Utilized **Redis** as a high-performance, in-memory data store for short-lived data like OTPs. This ensures rapid storage and retrieval with automatic expiration, crucial for time-sensitive operations.
- **Reliable Email Delivery:** Integrated **Nodemailer** (via `@nestjs-modules/mailer`) for sending transactional emails (e.g., OTPs). This provides a reliable and configurable solution for critical user communications.
- **Monorepo Management:** Employed **Nx** to manage multiple NestJS applications and shared libraries within a single repository. This solves challenges related to code sharing, consistent tooling, and simplified dependency management in a microservices environment.
- **Automated API Documentation:** Configured **Swagger** for automatic generation of interactive API documentation. This eliminates manual documentation efforts, keeps documentation in sync with the codebase, and provides a user-friendly interface for API exploration and testing.
- **Robust Configuration Management:** Leveraged `@nestjs/config` for secure and flexible environment variable management, ensuring sensitive data is handled correctly across different environments.
- **Dependency Resolution in Monorepos:** Addressed complex module resolution issues (e.g., Prisma client, Webpack path aliases) inherent in monorepos, ensuring a smooth development experience.

## üß† Lessons Learned

As a first-time user of NestJS and Redis, transitioning from Express.js, this project provided invaluable insights:

- **NestJS: The Power of Opinionated Frameworks:**

  - **Structure and Modularity:** Coming from the more unopinionated nature of Express.js, NestJS's clear module, controller, and service structure initially felt restrictive but quickly proved its worth. It enforces a highly organized and scalable architecture, making it easier to manage complex applications and onboard new developers.
  - **Dependency Injection (DI):** Understanding and leveraging NestJS's DI system was a significant learning curve but a game-changer. It simplifies testing, promotes loose coupling, and makes code more maintainable. The `UnknownDependenciesException` was a clear indicator of when DI wasn't correctly configured, forcing a deeper understanding of module imports and exports.
  - **Decorators and Metadata:** The extensive use of decorators (`@Module`, `@Controller`, `@Injectable`, `@Get`, `@Post`, etc.) provides a powerful and concise way to define application logic and metadata, streamlining development compared to manual routing and middleware setup in Express.
  - **Built-in Features:** NestJS's out-of-the-box support for features like validation pipes, exception filters, and Swagger integration significantly reduces boilerplate and accelerates development, allowing focus on business logic.

- **Redis: Beyond a Simple Cache:**
  - **Versatility:** Redis proved to be far more than just a caching layer. Its ability to handle various data structures (strings for OTPs, with expiration) made it ideal for time-sensitive, temporary data storage, which is crucial for OTP systems.
  - **Performance:** The speed of Redis for read/write operations is remarkable, making it perfect for high-throughput scenarios like OTP generation and verification.
  - **Connection Management:** Understanding how to properly manage Redis client connections (e.g., `ioredis` client lifecycle with `onModuleInit` and `onModuleDestroy`) was key to preventing connection leaks and ensuring application stability.

This project reinforced the value of structured frameworks for large-scale applications and the power of specialized tools like Redis for specific data handling needs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a microservices pattern, orchestrated within an Nx monorepo.

- **`apps/api-gateway`**: The entry point for all client requests, responsible for routing and potentially request aggregation.
- **`apps/auth-service`**: A dedicated service handling all authentication and authorization logic, including user management, JWT issuance/validation, and OTP flows.
- **`libs/common`**: A shared library containing common utilities, filters, and middleware used across multiple services, promoting code reuse and consistency.
- **Prisma**: Used as the ORM for database interactions, providing a type-safe and efficient way to manage data.

To get this project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v9 or higher recommended)
- Docker (for Redis, if not using a cloud provider)
- A Redis instance (local Docker or cloud provider like Upstash)
- SMTP credentials (e.g., from Mailtrap.io for testing)
- Auth0 API credentials (Domain, Audience)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tec-shop.git
    cd tec-shop
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in `apps/auth-service/` with the following structure, filling in your credentials:

    ```env
    # Auth0 Credentials
    AUTH0_ISSUER_URL=https://<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>/
    AUTH0_AUDIENCE=<YOUR_AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER>

    # Redis Connection (e.g., from Upstash)
    REDIS_URL="rediss://default:YOUR_UPSTASH_PASSWORD@your-upstash-host:6379"

    # SMTP Email Configuration (e.g., from Mailtrap.io sandbox)
    SMTP_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
    SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
